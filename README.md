# AssemblyLite
AssemblyLite is a free, open-source mapfile editor for Halo 2 Vista. Based on [Assembly](https://github.com/XboxChaos/Assembly), this project drops support for all Xbox versions of Halo.

### Rationale
[MetroWPFTemplate](https://github.com/Xerax/MetroWPFTemplate) is a stripped-down version of Assembly which is supposed to provide a good starting point for WPF applications with a Metro appearance. MetroWPFTemplate falls flat, however, due to lack of updates and numerous rough edges. Many GUI improvements to Assembly have not been backported to MetroWPFTemplate.

AssemblyLite was created to be a better MetroWPFTemplate, which includes updates made to Assembly's GUI framework as well as fully-functioning controls for editing Halo 2 mapfiles, which serve as examples of how to develop one's own Metro-styled WPF controls.
