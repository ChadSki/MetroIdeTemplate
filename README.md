# QuickbeamLite
QuickbeamLite is a free and open-source template for Metro-styled IDE-like applications. Based on [Assembly](https://github.com/XboxChaos/Assembly), this project drops Blamlib-based support for editing Halo.

### Rationale
[MetroWPFTemplate](https://github.com/Xerax/MetroWPFTemplate) is a stripped-down version of Assembly which is supposed to provide a good starting point for WPF applications with a Metro appearance. MetroWPFTemplate falls flat, however, due to lack of updates and numerous rough edges. Many GUI improvements to Assembly have not been backported to MetroWPFTemplate. QuickbeamLite was created to be a better MetroWPFTemplate, which includes updates made to Assembly's GUI framework.
