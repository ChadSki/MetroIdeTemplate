# ModernIdeTemplate
ModernIdeTemplate is a free and open-source template for Modern (aka Metro) styled IDE-like applications. Based on [Assembly](https://github.com/XboxChaos/Assembly), this project drops Blamlib-based support for editing Halo.

### Rationale
[MetroWPFTemplate](https://github.com/Xerax/MetroWPFTemplate) is a stripped-down version of Assembly which is supposed to provide a good starting point for WPF applications with a Modern/Metro appearance. MetroWPFTemplate falls flat, however, due to lack of updates and numerous rough edges. Many GUI improvements to Assembly have not been backported to MetroWPFTemplate. ModernIdeTemplate was created to be a better MetroWPFTemplate, which includes recent updates to Assembly's GUI.
