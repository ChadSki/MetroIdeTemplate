# MetroIdeTemplate
MetroIdeTemplate is a free and open-source template for Modern (aka Metro) styled
IDE-like applications. Based on [Assembly](https://github.com/XboxChaos/Assembly),
this project drops Blamlib-based support for editing Halo.

### Rationale
Although MetroIdeTemplate's codebase is a fork of Assembly, it is a spiritual descendant
of [MetroWPFTemplate](https://github.com/Xerax/MetroWPFTemplate) -- an earlier fork of
the Assembly codebase which was supposed to provide a good starting point for WPF
applications with a Metro appearance. However, that project contains numerous rough edges
and lacks updates. MetroIdeTemplate attempts to succeed MetroWPFTemplate by incorporating
recent improvements to Assembly with additional polish and generalization.

### License
As a fork of Assembly, MetroIdeTemplate falls under the GPLv2+ license.
